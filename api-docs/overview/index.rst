About the API
-------------

Rackspace Cloud Filesâ„¢ is an affordable, redundant, scalable, and
dynamic storage service. The core storage system is designed to provide
a secure, network-accessible way to store an unlimited number of files.
Each file can be as large as 5 gigabytes. You can store as much as you
want and pay only for storage space that you actually use.

Cloud Files also provides a simple yet powerful way to publish and
distribute content behind a content delivery network (CDN). As a Cloud
Files user, you get access to this network automatically.

Cloud Files enables you to store and retrieve files and CDN-enabled
content through a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) web services
interface. There are also language-specific application programming
interfaces (APIs) that use the RESTful API and make it easy for
developers to integrate into their applications.

This document describes the features available with API |contract version|.
