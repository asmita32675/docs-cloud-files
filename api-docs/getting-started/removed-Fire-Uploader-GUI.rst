FireUploader GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FireUploader, a tool from Suchi Software, provides an intuitive
interface for moving and managing files and metadata in Cloud Files. It
works as a plug-in to the Mozilla Firefox browser, and it provides a
creative way of working with available Cloud Files features to allow
users to simulate a hierarchical file system structure. While setting up
the tool, you must supply your Rackspace Cloud username; when prompted
for a password, enter your API key. For more information, see the
FireUploader web site at http://www.fireuploader.com.
