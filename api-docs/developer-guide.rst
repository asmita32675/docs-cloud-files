This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to develop
applications by using the REST application programming interface (API) for the
Rackspace Cloud Files service.

To use the information provided here, you should have a general understanding
of the :how-to:`Rackspace Cloud Files service<cloud-files>` and have a
`Rackspace Cloud account`_ with access to the Cloud Files service. You should
also be familiar with the following technologies:

-  *RESTful* web services

-  *HTTP*/1.1

-  JSON data serialization format

System administrators and others interested in the storage and CDN
benefits of Cloud Files should consider using the File Manager interface
within the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel, `Jungle
Disk <http://www.jungledisk.com/>`__, or third-party tools such as
`Cyberduck <http://www.cyberduck.ch/>`__. The Rackspace Cloud Control
Panel provides an easy to use web-based interface for uploading content
to and downloading content from Cloud Files.
