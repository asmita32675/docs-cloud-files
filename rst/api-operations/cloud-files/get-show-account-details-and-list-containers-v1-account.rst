Show Account Details And List Containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Request <get-show-account-details-and-list-containers-v1-account.html#request>`__
`Response <get-show-account-details-and-list-containers-v1-account.html#response>`__

.. code::

    GET /v1/{account}

Shows details for a specified account and lists containers, sorted by name, in the account.

This operation lists the storage containers in your account and sorts them by name. You perform the operation against your storage account URL.

The list is limited to 10,000 containers at a time. For information on limiting and navigating the list, see the following section, "Controlling a Large List of Containers". 

Container names are sorted based on a binary comparison, a built-in collating function that compares string data by using SQLite's ``memcmp()`` function, regardless of text encoding. For more information, see `http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#collation <http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#collation>`__.

A list of containers is returned in the response body, one container per line. 

The character sequence used to create the newline that separates the container names is a single \n. If you want to parse these listings, you send an ``Accept: application/json`` or ``Accept: application/xml`` header with the request to get the results in JSON or XML.

An HTTP response status code of 200 through 299 indicates success. A 200 (OK) code is returned if there are containers, and a 204 (No Content) code is returned if there are no containers.

Format Container List

If you append the ``?format=xml`` or ``?format=json`` query parameter to the storage account URL, the service returns container information serialized in the specified format. To format your results, you must place this query parameter before any other parameters. 

The example responses in this section are formatted for readability. 

Controlling a Large List of Containers

A ``GET`` operation on the storage account URL returns a list of up to 10,000 container names. You can control and limit this list of results by using the ``marker``, ``end_marker``, and ``limit`` parameters. These parameters provide a mechanism for iterating through the entire list of containers. 

The ``marker`` parameter tells Cloud Files where to begin your list of containers, and the ``end_marker`` parameter specifies where to end the list. You can use them independently or together, separated by an ampersand ( ``&`` ). If you do not specify them, your list displays up to 10,000 containers. Note that the ``marker`` and ``end_marker`` values must be URL-encoded before you send the HTTP request.

You can use the ``limit`` parameter to reduce the number of returned objects. 

If the number of returned items equals the ``limit`` used (or 10,000 if no ``limit`` was specified), you can assume there are more object names.

.. note::
   At this time, a ``prefix`` query parameter is not supported at the account level.
   
   

As an example, start with an account that has five container names, as follows:

apples bananas kiwis oranges pears

Use a limit of 2 to show how things work:

GET /v1/MossoCloudFS_0672d7fa-9f85-4a81-a3ab-adb66a880123?limit=2 Host: storage.clouddrive.com X-Auth-Token: f064c46a782c444cb4ba4b6434288f7c apples bananas

Because the operation returned two items, assume there are more container names to list and make another request with a marker of the last item returned:

GET /v1/MossoCloudFS_0672d7fa-9f85-4a81-a3ab-adb66a880123?limit=2&marker=bananas Host: storage.clouddrive.com X-Auth-Token: f064c46a782c444cb4ba4b6434288f7c kiwis oranges

Again, two items are returned, and you assume that there might be more. So you make another GET request for two more:

GET /v1/MossoCloudFS_0672d7fa-9f85-4a81-a3ab-adb66a880123?limit=2&marker=oranges Host: storage.clouddrive.com X-Auth-Token: f064c46a782c444cb4ba4b6434288f7c pears

This one-item response shows fewer than the limit of 2 container names requested, and indicates that this is the end of the list.

By using the ``end_marker`` parameter, you can limit the result set to container names less than the given value.

GET /v1/MossoCloudFS_0672d7fa-9f85-4a81-a3ab-adb66a880123?end_marker=oranges Host: storage.clouddrive.com X-Auth-Token: f064c46a782c444cb4ba4b6434288f7c apples bananas kiwis
