Sending requests to the APIÂ 
=========================================================

This section include the following information about sending requests to the API:

-  Prerequisites for running examples 
-  Sending API requests by using cURL 
-  Copying and pasting cURL request examples into a terminal window 

You have several options for sending requests through an API including
the following:

-  Developers and testers might prefer to use cURL, the command-line
   tool from http://curl.haxx.se/. With cURL, you can send HTTP requests
   and receive responses back from the command line.

-  If you like to use a more graphical interface, the REST client for
   Mozilla Firefox works well for testing and trying out commands. See
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/.

-  You can download and install RESTClient, a Java application used to
   test RESTful web services, from
   http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/.
