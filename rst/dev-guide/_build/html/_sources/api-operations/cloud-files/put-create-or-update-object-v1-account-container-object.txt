Create Or Update Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

    PUT /v1/{account}/{container}/{object}

Creates or updates the content and metadata for a specified object.

Perform ``PUT`` operations to write, or overwrite, an object's content and metadata.

.. note::
   The ``PUT`` operation actually always creates a new object. If you use this operation on an existing object, you actually replace the existing object and metadata rather than modifying the object. This is why this operation returns a 201 Created status code.
   
   

You can ensure end-to-end data integrity by including an MD5 checksum of your object's data in the ``ETag`` header. You are not required to include the ``ETag`` header, but we recommend its use to ensure that the storage system successfully stores your object's content.

You can cause an object to expire after a certain date and time by using the ``X-Delete-At`` or ``X-Delete-After`` headers during an object ``PUT`` operation. The ``X-Delete-At`` header requires a Unix epoch timestamp, in integer form. For example, 1348691905 represents Wed, 26 Sep 2012 20:38:25 GMT. By setting the header to a specific epoch time, you indicate when you want the object to expire, not be served, and be deleted completely from the storage system. When Cloud Files detects one of these headers, the system automatically stops serving that object at the specified date and time, and shortly after the expiration date, it removes the object from the storage system.

The HTTP response includes the MD5 checksum of the data written to the storage system. If you do not send the ``ETag`` header in the request, you should compare the value returned with your content's MD5 locally to perform the end-to-end data validation on the client side. For manifest objects, ``ETag`` is the MD5 checksum of the concatenated string of ETags for each segment in the manifest, which offers change detection but not direct comparison.

For more information, see `Creating large objects <http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/v1/cf-devguide/content/Create-Large-Objects-d10e.html>`__.

.. note::
   The best checks for a successful upload are to check the ``ETag`` match with a checksum and to see if you get a 404 (Not Found) status code when you perform a ``GET``, ``HEAD``, ``POST``, or ``DELETE`` operation.
   
   

You can assign custom metadata to objects by including additional HTTP headers in the ``PUT`` request. To assign custom metadata, use an HTTP header with the ``X-Object-Meta-`` prefix. 

You can also specify the ``Content-Type`` header for your object. For example, you can specify ``Content-Type: audio/mpeg3`` for MP3 files. 

A status code of 201 (Created) indicates a successful write. Any status code in the 400 range denotes failure. The 401 (Unauthorized) status code is returned if authentication fails. The 411 (Length Required) status code denotes a missing ``Content-Length`` or ``Content-Type`` header in the request. If the MD5 checksum of the data written to the storage system does not match the optionally supplied ``ETag`` value, a 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code is returned. 

No response body is returned.
