Create Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

    PUT /v1/{account}/{container}

Creates a container.

This operation creates a Cloud Files container. Containers are storage compartments for your data. The URL-encoded name must be no more than 256 bytes and cannot contain a forward slash character (/). You can create up to 500,000 containers in your Cloud Files account.

You can assign custom metadata for containers by including additional HTTP headers with an ``X-Container-Meta-`` prefix on the ``POST`` request. For details on setting custom metadata, see `Create or update account metadata <http://docs.rackspace.com/files/api/v1/cf-devguide/content/POST_updateaccountmeta_v1__account__accountServicesOperations_d1e000.html>`__. 

Using custom container metadata, you can create information in the header to effectively tag a container. The container metadata restrictions are the same as the restrictions for object metadata. You can have a maximum of 4096 bytes of metadata for the container, with a maximum of 90 distinct metadata items. Each distinct metadata item can have a name length of up to 128 characters with a maximum of 256 bytes in the value. Any valid UTF-8 encoded string value is allowed for metadata. In addition for custom metadata, we recommend that you URL-encode any non-ASCII values by using a % symbol followed by the two-digit hexadecimal ISO-Latin code for the character.

A status code of 201 (Created) indicates that the container was created as requested. Container ``PUT`` requests are idempotent, and a code of 202 (Accepted) is returned if the container existed prior to the request. If you make a ``PUT`` request to a container with an ``X-Container-Meta-`` prefix in the header, your ``GET`` or ``HEAD`` request responses carry the metadata prefix from the container in subsequent requests.

This operation does not require a request body and does not return a response body.
