    HEAD /v1/{account}/{container}/{object}

Shows object metadata.

Perform a HEAD operation on an object to retrieve object metadata and other standard HTTP headers.

This operation does not return a response body. Metadata is returned as HTTP headers.

.. note::
   JIRA ticket 1-/ 21 metadata / response clarity -- dsh 2012-03-07 The ``HEAD`` return code for an object is different than the ``HEAD`` return code for a container. A ``HEAD`` request does not return a message body in the response, so a status code of 200 through 299 indicates success. When a ``HEAD`` request is performed against a container, it queries the container databases, and it does not retrieve the content from them. Thus, this operation returns the 204 (No Content) status code. However, when a ``HEAD`` request is performed against an object, it returns a 200 OK status code because it can view the content. 
   
   



This table shows the possible response codes for this operation:
