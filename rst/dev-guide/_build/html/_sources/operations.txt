Operations
==========

Operations are the actions you perform within your account, such as
creating or deleting containers or uploading or downloading objects. For 
information about the Cloud Files API operations, see `Cloud Files API v1 
<http://api.rackspace.com/api-ref-files.html>`__.

You can perform operations through the REST web service API or a
language-specific API. For information about the Rackspace
language-specific APIs, see `SDKs & Tools 
<http://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/>`__.

.. note::
   All operations must include a valid authorization token.
