API |contract version| updates, February 21, 2014
-------------------------------------------------

What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Updated the following object methods to include the
   ``X-Detect-Content-Type`` header in the request:

   -  **PUT** (Create or Update Object)

   -  **POST** (Update Object Metadata)

   -  **COPY** (Copy Object)

   If you set this header to ``True``, the ``Content-Type`` that is sent
   in the request (if any) is ignored, and ``Content-Type`` is guessed
   by using the Python mimetypes library based on the object path.
