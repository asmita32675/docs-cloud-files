======================
Language-specific APIs
======================

APIs in several popular languages are available to help put Cloud Files
in the hands of developers. These language-specific APIs provide a layer
of abstraction on top of the base REST API, enabling developers to work
with a container and object model instead of working directly with HTTP
requests and responses. The language-specific APIs are available at no
cost to download, use, and modify. They are licensed under the MIT
license as described in the COPYING file packaged with each API.

If you make any improvements to a Cloud File language-specific API, you
are encouraged (but not required) to submit those changes back to
Rackspace. If you want to suggest changes to an API, send an email to
sdk-support@rackspace.com. Be sure to indicate which language and
version you modified and send a unified ``diff``.

Detailed information about the language-specific APIs is in the
Rackspace Cloud SDKs Software Development Kit Guide. Each API has its
own documentation (in HTML, PDF, or CHM format) including code snippets
and examples to help you get started.

You are welcome to create your own language-specific APIs. Rackspace
will help answer any questions during development, host your code if you
like, and give you full credit for your work.
