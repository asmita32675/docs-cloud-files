Operations
==========

Operations are the actions you perform within your account, such as
creating or deleting containers or uploading or downloading objects.

You can perform operations through the REST web service API or a
language-specific API. For information about the Rackspace
language-specific APIs, see `developer.rackspace.com <http://developer.rackspace.com/>`__.

.. note::
   All operations must include a valid authorization token.
