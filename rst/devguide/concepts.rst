Cloud Files is not a file system in the traditional sense. You cannot
map or mount virtual disk drives like you can with other forms of
storage such as a SAN or NAS. Because Cloud Files is a different kind of
storage system, you should take a few moments to review the following
key concepts in this section.

Accounts
--------

The Cloud Files system is designed to be used by many different
customers. Your user account is your portion of the Cloud Files system.
You must identify yourself with your Rackspace Cloud user name and API
access key. After you are authenticated, you have full read/write access
to the files stored under your account. To obtain a Cloud Files account
and enable your API access key, go to
`http://www.rackspacecloud.com/signup <https://cart.rackspace.com/cloud/?cp_id=cloud_files>`__.
