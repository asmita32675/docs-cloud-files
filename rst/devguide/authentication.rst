Authentication
==============

The Identity Guide describes how to authenticate against the Rackspace Cloud
Identity service to receive Cloud Files connection parameters and an
authentication token. The token must be passed to Cloud Files operations
during the time that it is valid.

For more information about authentication, see the *Cloud Identity
Client Developer Guide, v2.0*.

.. note::
   The language-specific APIs handle authentication, token passing, and
   HTTPS request/response communication.
